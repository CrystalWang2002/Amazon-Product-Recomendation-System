### 🚀 Hello, Welcome to Amazon Sales Data Analysis project! 
### This is the Link for APP： https://amazon-sales-recommendation-system-bi.streamlit.app/
### 🔍Dataset Introduction:
In this project, I will analyze Amazon Sales Dataset. This dataset contains 1k+ pieces of specific information 
         about Amazon products with product ids, prices, discounts, categories, customer reviews and other important 
         details. Analyzing this Dataset will provide in-depth insights into market trends, consumer behavior, 
         pricing strategies, and product performance to support more effective business decisions.

### 📊Exploratory Data Analysis:
I will conduct an exploratory data analysis mainly focusing on the following aspects:
- Sales Distribution
- Discount Distribution
- Customer Rating and Reviews
- Correlation Analysis
         
### 📈Recommendation System:
Finally, I will build a content-based recommendation system that recommends similar products to the user based on their purchasing history.
You can type the user id and get product recommendations for that user.

✨Let's GO!🌐✨
